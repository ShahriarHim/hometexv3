SIMILAR PRODUCTS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
=====================================

The similar products feature has been successfully integrated into the ProductDetail page.

## Changes Made:

### 1. API Functions (src/lib/api.ts)
   - Added `getSimilar(productId)` - Fetches similar products for a given product ID
   - Added `getByIds(productIds[])` - Fetches multiple products by their IDs (for future use)

### 2. ProductDetail Component (src/views/ProductDetail.tsx)
   - Added state management for similar products
   - Automatically fetches similar products when a product is loaded
   - Displays similar products in a beautiful grid layout with ProductCard components

## How It Works:

1. When a user views a product (e.g., product ID 412), the component:
   - Fetches the main product details
   - Automatically calls the API: `GET /api/products/412/similar`
   - Receives an array of similar products
   - Displays them in a responsive grid below the product details

2. The API response structure matches what you provided:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Similar products retrieved successfully",
     "data": {
       "products": [...]
     }
   }
   ```

3. Each similar product is displayed using the ProductCard component with:
   - Product image
   - Name
   - Price (with original price if discounted)
   - Rating and review count
   - Stock status
   - Badges (Featured, New, Trending, etc.)

## Usage Example:

The implementation is automatic! When you navigate to any product page:
- URL: `/products/412` (or any product ID)
- The page will automatically show similar products at the bottom

## API Endpoints Used:

1. **Get Similar Products:**
   - Endpoint: `https://www.hometexbd.ltd/api/products/{productId}/similar`
   - Example: `https://www.hometexbd.ltd/api/products/412/similar`

2. **Get Product by ID (for multiple products):**
   - Endpoint: `https://www.hometexbd.ltd/api/products/{productId}`
   - Can be used with the `getByIds()` function for batch fetching

## UI/UX Features:

✓ Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop)
✓ Loading indicator while fetching similar products
✓ Graceful error handling (no errors shown to user if API fails)
✓ Seamless integration with existing ProductCard component
✓ Automatic transformation of API data to UI-compatible format

## Future Enhancements:

You can also fetch products by specific IDs using the new `getByIds()` function:

```typescript
// Example: Fetch products with IDs 30, 31, 32
const response = await api.products.getByIds([30, 31, 32]);
if (response.success) {
  setSimilarProducts(response.data.products);
}
```

This is useful if you want to hardcode specific product recommendations.

## Testing:

To test the feature:
1. Navigate to any product page (e.g., `/products/412`)
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page
3. You should see a "Similar Products" section with product cards
4. The section only appears if similar products are available

## Note:

The linter error on Line 429 is a pre-existing TypeScript issue with Next.js Link component
and is not related to the similar products feature.
